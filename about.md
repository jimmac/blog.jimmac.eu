I mostly do <a rel="me" href="https://jimmac.eu">design</a>.

I post sketches and art on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jimmac) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/jimmacfx). I used to [photograph](https://photo.jimmac.eu/) a lot, but waste hours and hours on [video](https://vimeo.com/jimmacfx) these day. I used to [race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMdIYyGLNbA) but now only [enjoy flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il7ac0EHzS8) drones. After a 20 year hiatus I've resumed my love for [electronic music](https://music.jimmac.eu).
