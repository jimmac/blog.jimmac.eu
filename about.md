I mostly do [design](https://jimmac.eu).

I post sketches and art on [my Instagram](https://instagram.com/jimmacfx_icons). I used to do photography a lot, but waste hours and hours on video these day.

I used to [race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMdIYyGLNbA) but now only [enjoy flying](https://instagram.com/jimmacfx) drones.

After a 20 year hiatus I've resumed my love for [electronic music]().
