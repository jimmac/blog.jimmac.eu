I mostly do <a rel="me" href="https://jimmac.eu">design</a>.

I post sketches and art on [my Instagram](https://instagram.com/jimmacfx_icons). I used to do photography a lot, but waste hours and hours on video these day. I used to [race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMdIYyGLNbA) but now only [enjoy flying](https://vimeo.com/474846688) drones. After a 20 year hiatus I've resumed my love for [electronic music](https://soundcloud.com/jimmac).
