My first encounter with a digital camera was around 1996 when my university IT department acquired the [Apple Quicktake 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_QuickTake). While the quality of the output was laughable compared to the analog counterparts, the convenience of such a device was clear. It wasn't too long after that when I got my first digital camera, the Ricoh RDC-5000 which I used to capture the new worlds I vistited. Many devices followed.

Ever since I switched from photo to video as my default media format of capturing places and moments, there have been three major attributes I would seek out of a camera. A nice separation of subjects using shallow depth of field, a dreamy slow motion look using high frame rates and a pleasing image using optical or electronic stabilization.

All of these fields have been getting steady improvements and I always fantasize how my young self would react to seeing footage taken from a tiny little rectangle I carry around in my pocket. 
It is just incredible that the footage below is hand held and the cameraman is not driving a onewheel or using a gimbal, steadycam or some other aid. Just ninja walking. When do we stop calling these magic bricks phones?
