Spending less and less time on each track in [Weeklybeats](https://weeklybeats.com/jimmac) is making me a little nervous as to whether I will be able to finish such a marathon.

However a radical constraint of a single hour to lay down a pattern and record a jam, perhaps spending a few extra minutes to produce a video, has been extremely satisfying.

Even not being able to figure out how to do dual mono mix on the M8 is not a show stopper in such scenario (apologies to every one using headphones).

I hope a proper spring comes soon as I can't wait to FPV. This one pack in the garden was *painful* on the fingers.
