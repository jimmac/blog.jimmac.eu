As mentioned in the [previous post]({% post_url 2022-09-16-evenmopixels/2022-09-16-evenmopixels %}) I've been creating these short pixel art animations for [twitter](https://twitter.com/jimmac) and [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/web/@jimmac) to promote the lovely apps that sprung up under the umbrella of the [GNOME Circle project](https://circle.gnome.org). 

I was surprised the video gets actually quite long. It's true that a little something every day really adds up. The music was composed on the [Dirtywave M8](https://dirtywave.com) and the composite and sequence assembled in [Blender](https://blender.org).

Please take the time to enjoy this fullscreen for that good'ol CRT feel. If you're a maintainer or contributer to any of the apps featured, thank you!
