GUADEC 2023 is underway in Riga. It's great to see people face to face after [a long time](https://vimeo.com/412021025). Kicked off the first day with an [ADHD trip of a talk](https://www.youtube.com/live/dVVyokoQl2k?feature=share). Rather than putting links in [my slides](https://jimmac.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/riga-2023-jack-of-all-trades/#1), where nobody has the chance of actually follow, I've assembled them here. Enjoy!


* **[Color Pallette](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.design.Palette)**. Useful tool to get GNOME colors across your toolchain.
* **[App Icon Preview](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.design.AppIconPreview)**. Design app icons.
* **[OS Component Website Template](https://github.com/jimmac/os-component-website)**. A template to get your pixel art laden component website up and running in a nanosecond.
* **Beziers**. An epic [video on the elegance and control over bezier curves, by Freya Holm√©r](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw).
