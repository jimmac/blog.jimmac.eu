Probably only a fraction of you had a chance to see [Droneman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10288320/) in a theatre. It's available on Netflix, so perhaps not universally, but ever so slightly more available to a global audience. Why would I be plugging a movie? Because it's [my only entry in IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12369333/) and features a spectacular performance by my son, that's why!
