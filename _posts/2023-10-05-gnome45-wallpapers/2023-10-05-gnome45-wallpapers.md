With the [45 release out the door](https://release.gnome.org/45/), it would be a shame not to reveal some of the behind the scenes for the new wallpapers.

I'll start off by mentioning a lovely new addition by David Lapshin, [Amber](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-backgrounds/-/issues/37), leaning into Inkscape's mesh gradients.

The default has shown no dramatic departure from the triangles/hexagons of the previous releases. The on-brand triangle theme has been kept, but the implementation is very different. The wallpaper is a result of a generated mesh using Blender's geometry nodes and color gradients derived from a pre-existing wallpaper texture. You can check the whole thing out in the provided blender project files in [wallpaper-assets](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/wallpaper-assets).

There have been updates to the existing set, the surprisingly popular [Blobs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-backgrounds/-/blob/gnome-45/backgrounds/blobs-d.svg?ref_type=heads) have been tweaked, my personal favorite, [Fold](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-backgrounds/-/blob/gnome-45/backgrounds/fold-l.jpg?ref_type=heads) crops a bit better at the most common 16:9 aspect and [Truchet](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-backgrounds/-/blob/gnome-45/backgrounds/truchet-d.jpg?ref_type=heads) is round yet again. [Pixels](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-backgrounds/-/blob/gnome-45/backgrounds/pixels-d.jpg?ref_type=heads) have been updated to feature [Circle apps](https://circle.gnome.org/).

Weirdly named [Morphogenesis](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-backgrounds/-/blob/gnome-45/backgrounds/morphogenesis-l.svg?ref_type=heads) is one of my favorite additions this release. Based around a concept of reactive diffusion, described by none other than [Allan Turing](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf), features a little easter egg if you're into chasing those down.
