Things are hectic and busy here on Earth. [We may have disrupted](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/feb/17/arctic-heating-winter-storms-climate-change) the seeemingly eternal atmospheric streams by warming up the planet. We seem to be really terrible at dealing with a viral threat we've known about for a long time. We're doing a lot of bad things as species.

But today I won't be bitching about our government failing to distribute vaccines handed to them on a silver platter. I'll be admiring the work of another government agency that did amazingly organizing resources and talent and will be landing the Perseverance rover on Mars at 19:15 UTC.
