Someone asked me the other day if I plan to resume work on my pet project, Gorilla. I thought it's worth replying in public.

Continuing to embrace the _unique_ Gorilla style I would be undoing hundreds of hours of work we invested in the [Tango project](https://librearts.org/2009/07/dancing-tango-on-the-desktop/). I am happy to see people willingly or inadvertently staying within the boundaries set by [the guidelines](https://web.archive.org/web/20150212071236/http%3A%2F%2Ftango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines). There is nothing worse than getting a fan mail from someone who has assembled a "theme" composed of all the clashing styles you have created. 

Gorilla, you're my (the?) first SVG icon set, you are my darling. But the world is better without you. Rest in peace.
