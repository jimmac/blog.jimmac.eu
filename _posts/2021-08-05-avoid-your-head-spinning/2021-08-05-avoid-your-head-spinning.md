In a versatile tool like Inkscape, there are always features that aren't for you. There are some that really get in your way though, like the recently added *canvas rotation*.

If you're like me and constantly keep triggering it by accident (Blender zooming being Inkscape's panning having to do with it), you'll be happy to learn it can be completely disabled. Sip on your favorite beverage and dive into the thick preferences dialog again (`Edit>Preferences`), this time you're searching for `Lock canvas rotation by default` in the `Interface` section. One more thing that might throw you off is that you need to restart Inkscape for the change to have any effect.

If you don't wish to go nuclear on the function, do note it can be reset from the status bar bottom right.
