Since the start of the year I've been doing [weeklybeats](https://weeklybeats.com/). So far it's been possible mainly thanks to the [Dirtywave M8](https://dirtywave.com)'s ability to be picked up, instantly turned on and creating. I have to admit to mostly composing in bed (and only occasionally waking up my better half by shaking to the beat).

I'm not going to be spamming the [planet](https://planet.gnome.org) with every track, but I do want to share some that I feel worked out. This one is a jam done on the Digitakt (that I actually modified to run on a li-ion battery) and the M8 doing most of the heavy lifting. The track started by setting up [Fugue Machine](https://alexandernaut.com/fuguemachine/) like sequence in the M8. A friend of mine suggested to spice the ambient with a bit of a beat, which I used a Digitakt for. I now map the mixer on the M8 onto the 8 encoders of the Digitakt, but for the jam I was still using the internal keypad.

I really enjoy stepping back into my tracking shoes after two decades, especially when I ran into the old [Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeskola_Buzz) crew on the Dirtywave Discord server. Shout out to [Ilya](https://weeklybeats.com/ilzxc) and [Noggin'](https://weeklybeats.com/noggin) who've made my re-entry to music super enjoyable.
