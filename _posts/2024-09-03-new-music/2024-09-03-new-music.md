I haven't done a good job posting to my blog this year and this is the first step to correct it. I self-censor myself too much, thinking it's not worth a longer form and [post on mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jimmac) most of the time, but it's worth being able to go back to things as I've done many times in the past. The stream on fediverse is just too strong to be able to.

# Worthy Music
Of course I mostly listen to the music I know, the music of my younger self. But I also seek new music. Taking part in [Weekly Beats](https://weeklybeats.com) helps a lot. That's how I discovered a very talented artist with an unpronounceable name -- [Gesceap](https://gesceap.bandcamp.com/). I've put him into the same box as Chris Leary aka Ochre, my old favorite. The tremendous detail of Gesceap's work is that he produces on a tiny little piece of software called [nanoloop](https://nanoloop.com/iphone/index.html). Just insane level of mastery within that constrained world.

Another artist I admire is [Ivar Tryti](https://ivartryti.bandcamp.com/). Absolute master of the Elektron boxes, he performs all his tunes with robotic speed and precision, but the music stands on its own. Truly love the way he works with energy.

# Berlin Performance
One of the personal highlights of this year's mini GUADEC has been showing off my Dirtywave M8. While the device locked up three times during the show (eek) as I was sporting a beta build to be able to use the Novation Launchpad Pro. Tim only added support for it like a week prior.

The crowd was amazing and it went much better than I expected and I kept going into DJ space and played for over 2.5 hours.
