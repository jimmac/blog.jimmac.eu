This post is very unlikely for you. It's for future me.

The little magic box that is the [Dirtywave M8 tracker](https://dirtywave.com/) is pretty well supported in Linux. It works great as an audio device (input and output), it does usb midi and you can also use its remote display using [laamaa's m8c](https://github.com/laamaa/m8c) which now also does audio monitoring.

M8c isn't an app, so it's a bit of a hassle to build it and use it from within a [toolbx](https://containertoolbx.org/). Regular Linux distro chore. In addition, to update its firmware, which [Timothy](https://trash80.com/) pushes very frequently and brings [amazing new functionality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DivKR6x5-Uo), requires adding udev rules to have the device writable by a user. Which is what this post is about. I have no clue what I'm doing, but having this config in `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-myusb.rules` (first is the regular device for m8c and the latter is the second stage of the firmware update using [tytools](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools/releases)):

```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="048a", GROUP="users", MODE="0666"
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", GROUP="users", MODE="0666"
```

Enjoy my last track, [Sines of our fathers](https://music.jimmac.eu/sines) if you don't care of any of the above ;)
