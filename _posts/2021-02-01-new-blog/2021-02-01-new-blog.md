In an effort to tone down my Facebook posts, I've been looking in ways how to leverage the amazing Apostrophe app for writing markdown. It does it with so much style and even previews inline images (and videos).

Due to github integration and general availability I've settled with jekyll, departing from middleman. Thanks to toolbox and rvm, the version dependency hell might be manageable, but I'm mainly hoping to just rely on github to do all the heavylifting, while I rely on Apostrophone. We'll see how it goes. 

The one downside of my hacky middleman setup is that I will need to manually port those blog posts over as it's a mess. A lot of it is related to image and video links and some `rb -> md`. 

Maybe I'll start posting photos again.
